Excited to share my project â€“ Reestar Hotel Website!

This project is built using only HTML and CSS, focusing on:
âœ… Clean and structured webpage layout
âœ… Attractive design with proper styling
âœ… Sections for menu, about, and contact

Through this project, I strengthened my basics in front-end development and gained hands-on experience in building a simple static website.

Looking forward to working on more projects and leveling up my web development skills! ðŸš€
